        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Interface Design course, our team, Unity, had to create an app that helps users in a professional context to adapt to the new balance between in-person and online activities under the COVID-19 pandemic. We decided to focus our app on the domain of fitness & health industry as our team understands that the pandemic has a significant impact on this industry. Thus, we created ProFit, an app that can help trainers to get through the tough times.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          We start by doing research on which domain we want to focus on. We chose fitness & health at last because all of us have friends working in this domain. We then researched how gyms had been running during the lockdown and after the restrictions have relaxed, as well as the challenges that personal trainers faced. After that, we created a fictional character based on our research in order to represent the target general user type, namely a persona, and created user flow, sketched wireframes, brand identity, and 4 sets of mock-ups using Protopie and UXPin.

      <div class="p6-text" >
        <p>
          After getting more critiques from TA, we finalized our design and create an interactive prototype using Figma and protopie, and conducted a user study on 5 users to improve the functionality and user experience problem that we had.

          Christy and Vincent are responsible for creating graphics in Figma and editing video in Final Cut Pro, while Vicky and my role are creating an interactive prototype using protopie. Other than interaction, I am the team leader and I will distribute tasks to my teammate. I also responsible for making sure the logic in prototypes by using coding and creating logos and graphics by using PhotoShop.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge throughout this project is implementing logic in our prototypes and ensuring the coding is able to run in protopie. At first, we only added jump interaction in our prototype and we noticed that it is not enough for logical use. Thus, we used coding condition in protopie, such as “if user didn’t input numbers, show a warning sentences”. The coding in protopie is different from what I learn in other courses. Therefore, I watched some tutorials in YouTube and their official website but it doesn’t work in my prototype. It still allows user to go to next page even they didn’t type numbers. I feel frustrated and keep watching tutorials but I still could not solve the problems. I tried different method by myself, and I solved the problem at last.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a huge success, and I think our team work between 4 of us is one of the factors. Beside of brainstorming the domain that we wanted to focus on and their challenges in COVID-19 pandemic, we also separate the work after we fianlized our idea and completed our mockup. And thus, we got figma team and protopie team. Moreover, our team got great communication so that each of us understand what we are responsible for. Other than that, listening skills is also part of the success. As we could only get limited critique and essential and condensed comments after our presentation from the TA, we need to break down and analyze his comments and finalizes the solutions as a team.
