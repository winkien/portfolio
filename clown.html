        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Spatial Thinking and Communicating course, my team was tasked with creating an Animated Beautiful Model (ABM) using SolidWorks. An ABM is a machine that combines mechanical components with aesthetics to produce a pleasant and surprising output when users interact with it. We chose to create a model called "Clown on a Unicycle" because we wanted to make something fun, lively, and joyful.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          To begin the project, our team brainstormed various ideas and discussed the possible movements that could be incorporated into our model. Our goal was to create a toy that would bring joy and cheer to those who interacted with it. We drew inspiration from Billy, a character from the horror movie Jigsaw, as well as Krusty the Clown from The Simpsons. We discussed and sketched rough designs for the model's housing and the mechanics of how it would operate.
        </p>

        <p>The model performs three motions: right-hand up and down, leg curl, and wheel rotation (left).
          <br>There are top, front, side, and inside views showing how the mechanics work, as well as an isometric view with the 3D parts' name labeled. (right)
        </p>
        
      </div>
      <div class="clown-text" >
        <p>
          Based on the sketches, we created a digital model in SolidWorks to demonstrate the mechanical motion. For the hand motion, I separated the forearm and arm and connected the parts to a four-bar linkage mechanism that is attached to one of the gears. For the leg curl and wheel rotation, I made two holes in the gear and used a bar to connect one hole to each wheel and lower leg. To ensure that the leg curls to the front, I created a small circular rail and used a leg pin to connect the upper and lower leg.

          (update in September 2020) 
          <br>Due to the pandemic, we were unable to create a physical model. Fortunately, my last co-op company allowed me to use their machine to build the model and expressed interest in seeing the final product. As a result, the project was resumed and I laser cut the parts while using a 3D printer for the inner components, including gears, bars, and pins.

        <img src="img/clown/106-demo.png" alt="106-demo">
        <p>I export the parts that were made in SolidWorks and created laser cut and 3D parts. I chose to use MDF for laser cutting because I am planning to decorate the model by gluing fabric and painting, as well as using white filament for the 3D parts. (left)
          <br>After I printed the parts, I used masking tape to make a demo product. (right)
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="clown-text" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
          After that, I used wood glue and masking tape to assemble the final physical model, and used fabric and paint to decorate it.

        <p>After using wood glue to stick the wooden parts and used acrylic paint on the face and hand, , I used cut the fabric and used white glue to stick them on the wood.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge throughout this project is transforming sketches into a 3D model since measuring the size of each part had to be precise. It was also a time-consuming task since I had to test the most suitable length of each motion mechanism to make sure they will not collide with other parts. In order to solve this challenge, I linked the mechanism part first and then adding the parts one at a time. This solution could help me make sure the mechanism motion is working and I do not have to keep changing the parts when I am testing the motion mechanism.
        <br><br>(after making the physical model)
        <br>Another challenge we encountered was that assembling the laser-cut and 3D-printed parts in real life differed from assembling them in SolidWorks. For example, the laser-cutting process burns the edges of the parts, making them slightly smaller than their digital dimensions, while the 3D-printed parts are exactly the same size as their digital dimensions. As a result, connecting the bar to the laser-cut parts results in a loose fit, requiring us to glue the parts together. On the other hand, it is very difficult to assemble two 3D-printed parts because there is no gap between them. To address this issue, I experimented with different hole sizes and used sandpaper to smooth the surfaces, enabling me to assemble the parts.

        <p>This is the first iteration of the gear. Since there is no gap between the two 3D parts, once I insert the pin into the gear, it cannot be rotated.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I learned how to use sketches to communicate. During the design process, my team came up with different ideas, so we put them on paper and discussed which one to choose based on the mechanism, material for the model, and our personal preferences. I believe it's important to choose a design that we both like, otherwise, we may lose our passion for creating the model. I think we did a great job on this project because the model met our expectations. Unfortunately, we were unable to create a physical model due to COVID-19. I hope we can make a physical model once school reopens.
