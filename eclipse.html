        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Materials in Design course, our team had to create a speaker and consider the material selection 
            based on durability, environmental effects, tactile properties, manufacturing processes, compatibility, 
            and effects of particular forms of use. We decided to design our speaker for users who have insomnia and 
            limited home space. Thus, we created Falling Eclipse, a speaker that can place on a flat surface as well 
            as hang from the ceiling, while maintaining a minimal and clean design. 
        </p>

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
            Before we started brainstorming and sketching our model, we first selected two primary materials for 
            our speaker, which are wood and fabric, and then we research one existing speaker that is already on 
            the market per each material to analyze its aesthetics, functionality, and materiality. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="eclipse-image" data-aos="fade-up">
        <img src="img/eclipse/material-poster.png" alt="336-poster">
        <p>The material poster that we researched two existing products of our primary materials, fabric, and wood
            with an analysis of those products.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="eclipse-text" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
            After we had done deep research, we had a better understanding of the materials. We decided to apply the 
            elastic characteristics of the fabric, and break the mindset that wood should be always flat. Thus, each 
            of us created 3 sketches to explore different possibilities of the speaker and decided on the persona. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="eclipse-image" data-aos="fade-up">
        <img src="img/eclipse/sketch.png" alt="336-sketch">
        <p>Each of us drew 3 sketches, in total 12 sketches.</p>
        <img src="img/eclipse/persona.png" alt="336-persona">
        <p>With the materials in mind, we created a persona and took into consideration integrating frustration, goal, 
            and occupation data to develop a genuine end-user.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="eclipse-text" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
            Combining our sketches, we created a new concept by using different sizes of circular wooden disks with fabric 
            in the middle for the sound to transmit through. After that, we created a low-fidelity prototype using styrene, 
            cardboard, and wool.

        <p>Our first concept of the speaker.</p>
        <img src="img/eclipse/low-fidelity.png" alt="336-low-fidelity">
        <p>We created two low-fidelity prototypes based on the concept. However, we realized the our initial concept (on the left 
            side) is very unstable. Therefore, we added a base and changed the strings to wooden dowels.</p>

      <div class="eclipse-text" data-aos="fade-up">
        <p>
            After receiving feedback from the professor and peers, we made some changes on the prototype. To create the actual 
            product, we first build a 1-to-1 scale model by using cardboard, wooden dowel, wool, and cotton as a demo to test 
            the sizes of each component and the dimension of the overall product.

        <p>After that, we finalized our material choice and used laser cutting for the wooden parts.

        <p>As we wanted a dark brown finish for the wooden dowels, we experimented with tinting them using black tea. However, we 
            realized the tinting method makes the shade of the wooden dowels uneven and it didnâ€™t meet the darkness we want.</p>
        <img src="img/eclipse/process8.png" alt="336-process8">
        <p>At last, we painted them using dark brown acrylic.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
            One biggest challenge of this project is dealing with the wooden part. As we wanted to use wood to surround the wooden 
            disc, we tried different variations of bendable patterns using laser cutting. For our first iteration, the gap between 
            the lines is too far apart so the wood immediately breaks when we try to bend it. Then, we modified our design pattern 
            by making the lines closer and we finally can bend them. However, the laser cut left a burnt mark on the wood which 
            will affect the aesthetics. Therefore, applying the knowledge from my previous coop, I applied masking tape on the wood 
            part that we need to laser cut to prevent the burnt mark, but it left a sticky residue after removing the tape. Lastly, 
            we used alcohol wipes to remove the residue. 
        </p>

      <div class="eclipse-image">
        <img src="img/eclipse/process1.png" alt="336-process1">
        <p>Right side were the first trial of the bendable wood pattern. We realized the gap between the lines were too far away so 
            it broke once we bend the wood. We modified our files and at last the wood can be bended as a circle as shown on the 
            left side.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout this project, I understand that fabrication is a time-consuming task and it is very hard to create a 
            perfect model based on the digital model. For example, we first experimented tinting the wooden dowels with black 
            tea but it turned out uneven shade and still too light compared to our expectations even though we tinted them for 
            2 days. Although we used acrylic paint for the wooden dowels lastly, I think it is a good practice to try tinting 
            to wood and explore how they will affect the outcome.
