        <h2>The Clown On A Unicycle</h2>
        <h4>Type: 3D Modelling, Graphics, Fabrication</h4>
        <h4>Team: Christy Lam</h4>
        <h4>Tools: Illustrator, SolidWorks, Maya</h4>
        <h4>Date: January to April 2020</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Spatial Thinking and Communicating course, my team had to create
           an Animated Beautiful Model (ABM) digitally by using SolidWorks. An
           ABM is a machine that combines mechanical components and aesthetics
           and presents a pleasant and surprising output motion when users interact
           with it. We created a model called the Clown on a Unicycle because we
           wanted to create a funny, lively and joyful model. Its concept is inspired
           by the character Billy from the horror movie <em>Jigsaw</em> and the
           Krusty the Clown from <em>The Simpsons</em>. The purpose of creating this
           model is to cheer people up when they see it, especially the kids.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          We first came up with different ideas and discussed the possible moves
          that could be performed on the models before deciding to create a clown
          model. We discussed and roughly sketched the housing of the model and
          how would the mechanical part work. My groupmate is responsible for
          sketching the parts and model by using Adobe Illustrator and creating
          a video to present our work by using Final Cut Pro, and my role is to
          follow the sketches and measure the suitable sizes of each part in order
          to create the digital model by using SolidWorks.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge throughout this project is transforming sketches into
          a 3D model since measuring the size of each part had to be precise. It
          was also a time-consuming task since I had to test the most suitable
          length of each motion mechanism to make sure they will not collide with
          other parts. In order to solve this challenge, I linked the mechanism
          part first and then adding the parts one at a time. This solution could
          help me make sure the mechanism motion is working and I do not have to
          keep changing the parts when I am testing the motion mechanism.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Throughout this project, I learnt how to use sketches to communicate.
          During the design process, my team had come up with different ideas,
          so we put our ideas on paper and discussed which one we should choose
          based on the mechanism, material for the model, and which one we like.
          I think choosing the one we both like is important, otherwise, we will
          lose our passion to design the model. I think we did a great job on this
          project since the model had met our expectations. Unfortunately, we were
          not able to make the physical model due to COVID-19. I hope that we were
          able to make a physical model after school reopening.
