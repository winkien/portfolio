        <h2>NOMI</h2>
        <h3>Magazine + Graphics</h3>
        <h4>Individual Project</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Graphic Design in Transition: Print and Digital Periodicals course,
          I had to create a magazine for both print and online. This project includes
          the cover, table of contents (TOC), editorial story, business card, online
          advertisement (box and tower) and online article. I created NOMI, a home
          decor magazine that focuses on interior design and decorating across Canada.
          NOMI is a Japanese word, not only stands for only one, unique and important,
          but also means beautiful, pleasant and delightful. I think this name matches
          the theme of my magazine as it will combine aesthetics, design trends
          and decorating advice for readers to explore and get inspiration for
          their unique home, and create their comfort zone and dream house.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          I first thought about what kind of magazine I would like to design. I
          chose home decor magazine because I was interested in interior design
          and wanted to explore how to create an effective home decor magazine.
          As my magazine aims to inspire and guide the readers to make their home
          a more comfortable, unique and delightful place, I searched online to
          see if any words have this kind of meaning, and I found NOMI. After that,
          I used a blinkplan to organize my magazine, such as the section and
          article’s name and created a mood board and template of the cover, TOC,
          and story. Then, I picked an article about Modern Bohemian Style as my
          cover editorial story and used the images in copyright-free websites
          to create the cover and story spread based on the template. Lastly, I
          created the subscription box and tower advertisement, business card, a
          sidebar, and two online editorial adaptations (one is the article, and
          one is the quiz to test which kind of decorating style suits you).

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Creating the TOC is the most challenging and difficult task for me
          because it is typographically and hierarchically complicated. When I
          first designed the TOC, I wanted to place all of them on one page as my
          magazine doesn’t have too many articles so it should be ok to place
          them on one page. However, I realized that it is very hard to do so as
          there aren't many white spaces between the images and texts. Thus, I
          used 2 pages to create TOC to make it more organized in a hierarchical
          and easy-to-follow way.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          The project allows me to understand how a new publication developed to
          the public, such as how to design an effective magazine - its brand,
          editorial, and marketing collateral - to gain reach and generate cross-platform
          traffic. I also learn the principles of both audience development and
          art direction, and how to effectively design and package editorial
          content for both print and online.
