        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Spatial Design course, our team, Blossom, had to create a pavilion and pergola that will be located in Holland Park in Surrey for either a sculpture, ceremonial or music recitals pavilion. We also had to apply spatial theories and concepts, such as elements and principles, circulation, light, human experiences and human factors, as well as syntactic language in the design of the building. Our team decided to create a ceremonial pavilion that will look like a flower from the top view. And that is also how we came up with our team name as well as the pavilion name, Bloom. We hope our pavilion would give a natural while elegant feeling when visitors enter it.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>
          Before we started brainstorming and sketching our model, we first went to Holland Park to explore and decided where our pavilion should be located. After that we had to cut different geometry shapes on fabric and try to explore the design of the building. We had two iterations of our design and both of them are inspired by a flower.

      <div class="p7-image2">
        <img src="img/p6/334-wireframe.png" alt="334-wireframe">
        <p>Using different fabric geometries to brainstorm - Our first idea is having a pavilion in the air supported by three triangular pillars at the bottom. However, we had to move our pavilion to another location as there is a statue underneath. [jpg]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p7-image2">
        <img src="img/p6/334-brand.png" alt="334-brand-identity">
        <p>Finalized location - Thus, we chose a new location that is neither close to the main road nor the household, so it will not disturb others and avoid noise by the public transportation when holding the ceremony. [jpg]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p7-text" >
        <p>
          We did not use the first iteration design because we figured out most of the design decisions were based on aesthetic reasons and we somehow ignored the functionalities. Also, the pergola is not very consistent with the design.

        <img src="img/p6/334-figma.png" alt="334-figma">
        <p>First iteration of pavilion sketch - we decided to have 4 walls expanding outwards as the petals and a half-sphere as the stamen. However, we noticed that the ceiling is not very functional as the walls will block the view and there is nothing to support the second floor. [jpg]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p7-image2" >
        <img src="img/p6/334-figma.png" alt="334-figma">

      </div>
      <div class="p7-text">
        <p>Lastly, we made the walls shorter so that it will still keep the “flower looking” from the top view while the guests on the second floor can see the view of the park. Moreover, we changed the pergola to inherit the frame elements of the ceiling so that it becomes more consistent. </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          The main challenge throughout this project is implementing logic in our prototypes and ensuring the coding is able to run in protopie. At first, we only added jump interaction in our prototype and we noticed that it is not enough for logical use. Thus, we used coding condition in protopie, such as “if user didn’t input numbers, show a warning sentences”. The coding in protopie is different from what I learn in other courses. Therefore, I watched some tutorials in YouTube and their official website but it doesn’t work in my prototype. It still allows user to go to next page even they didn’t type numbers. I feel frustrated and keep watching tutorials but I still could not solve the problems. I tried different method by myself, and I solved the problem at last.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a huge success, and I think our team work between 4 of us is one of the factors. Beside of brainstorming the domain that we wanted to focus on and their challenges in COVID-19 pandemic, we also separate the work after we fianlized our idea and completed our mockup. And thus, we got figma team and protopie team. Moreover, our team got great communication so that each of us understand what we are responsible for. Other than that, listening skills is also part of the success. As we could only get limited critique and essential and condensed comments after our presentation from the TA, we need to break down and analyze his comments and finalizes the solutions as a team.
