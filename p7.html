        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>In the Spatial Design course, our team, Blossom, had to create a pavilion and pergola that will be located in Holland Park in Surrey for either a sculpture, ceremonial or music recitals pavilion. We also had to apply spatial theories and concepts, such as elements and principles, circulation, light, human experiences and human factors, as well as syntactic language in the design of the building. Our team decided to create a ceremonial pavilion that will look like a flower from the top view. And that is also how we came up with our team name as well as the pavilion name, Bloom. We hope our pavilion would give a natural while elegant feeling when visitors enter it.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <p>Before we started brainstorming and sketching our model, we first went to Holland Park to explore and decided where our pavilion should be located. After that we had to cut different geometry shapes on fabric and try to explore the design of the building. We had two iterations of our design and both of them are inspired by a flower.

        <img src="img/p7/233-ica.jpg" alt="233-ica">
        <p>Using different fabric geometries to brainstorm - Our first idea is having a pavilion in the air supported by three triangular pillars at the bottom. However, we had to move our pavilion to another location as there is a statue underneath. [jpg]</p>

        <img src="img/p7/233-location2.png" alt="233-location2">
        <p>Finalized location - Thus, we chose a new location that is neither close to the main road nor the household, so it will not disturb others and avoid noise by the public transportation when holding the ceremony. [jpg]</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p7-text" >
        <p>
          We did not use the first iteration design because we figured out most of the design decisions were based on aesthetic reasons and we somehow ignored the functionalities. Also, the pergola is not very consistent with the design.
        </p>

        <p>First iteration of pavilion & pergola sketch - we decided to have 4 walls expanding outwards as the petals and a half-sphere as the stamen. However, we noticed that the ceiling is not very functional as the walls will block the view and there is nothing to support the second floor. [jpg]</p>

      </div>
      <div class="p7-text">
        <p>Lastly, we made the walls shorter so that it will still keep the “flower looking” from the top view while the guests on the second floor can see the view of the park. Moreover, we changed the pergola to inherit the frame elements of the ceiling so that it becomes more consistent. Vincent and I are responsible for creating the 3D model by using Rhino, and applying materials and creating the VR walkthrough in Twin Motion. Miji is responsible for the blog design as well as video editing, and TingYi is responsible for sketching. Other than that, all of us participated in fabricating the physical pergola. </p>

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>The main challenge throughout this project is to create the physical model of the pergola. The pergola is an irregular curved shape, thus we are not able to laser cut our pieces like other groups. At first, we thought that we could just use aluminum wires to create the pergola and then apply white paint spray. However, our group has 3 girls and aluminum wires are fairly hard for us to bend and have a higher chance to get hurt. Also, we want to distribute the work of fabrication evenly, so we could not go with the original material. After discussion, we chose to use the fluffy wires which have a softer surface, thus it is easier for us to bend and all group members can contribute to this process.         </p>
