        <h3>self reflection 1 - Jan 18, 2022</h3>
        <p>As majoring in Interactive Arts and Technology, I have a strong knowledge of graphic design, especially using digital media platforms such as Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator. Since I always interact with different kinds of new technology and digital media platforms throughout my courses, one of my main goals in this course is to learn more about theoretical knowledge in publishing as well as the social change topics in technology. I hope I can do better by combining my designing experiences and skills with popular social changes topics to create media on the Internet. Other than technology, I believe this course can help me learn more about social issues such as Feminism and LBGTQ rights.
          <br>
          I considered myself as a graphic designer and artist. Through my design courses and coop exprience, I understand the how to create appropriate designs based on the target audience and their preference in order to attract more readers. Thus, I think it will be easier for me to handle the assignments that are related to design.
          <br>
          I am not strong in verbal-linguistic intelligence and my mother language is not English, so I might take more time to read and write. Also, I am taking heavy workload courses with a part time job, which would be a big challenge for me.
          <br>
          I will spend more time in the assignments and discussions in order to explain my ideas clearly in both speaking and reading. In order to effectively mangae heavy workload throughout this semester, I will master my time management in order to prioritize my tasks everyday.
          I would also like to receive more feedback from professor and I would attend office hours to discuss the assignments if needed.
